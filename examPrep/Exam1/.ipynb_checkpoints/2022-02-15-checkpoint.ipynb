    "\n",
    "### General Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Python Programming (for Data Science)** exam session! Please, read **carefully** the instructions below before start writing code. \n",
    "\n",
    "This session will last **75 minutes** and is divided into **two parts**: one about \"general\" Python programming and the other about Python programming for Data Science. Each part is made of a set of exercises, which globally accounts for **15** + **15** = **30 points**.\n",
    "At the end of these two parts, there is a part related to Machine Learning which is a three-point bonus if you achieve at least a score of 22 in the first two parts.\n",
    "You will earn all of the points associated to an exercise **if and only if** the answer you provide passes successfully **all** the tests (both those that are visible and those that are hidden to you).\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually write down your implementation, make sure to fill in any place that says <code style=\"color:green\">**_# YOUR CODE HERE_**</code>. Note also that you should **either comment or delete** any <code style=\"color:green\">**raise NotImplementedError()**</code> exception.<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "(**Warning**: If you forget to delete the <code style=\"color:green\">**raise NotImplementedError()**</code> in an exercise, you will automatically lose two points for that exercise even if the code does not raise any error).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exam session **you will not be allowed** to use any lecture material yet you will be able to access the following APIs:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/index.html)\n",
    "-  [Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/)\n",
    "-  [Scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.0.0/reference/)\n",
    "-  [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.22/api.html)\n",
    "-  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/2.1.1/api/index.html)\n",
    "-  [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html)\n",
    "-  [SciKit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are done, save this notebook and rename it as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>**YOURUSERNAME_2022-02-15.ipynb**</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "where <code>**YOURUSERNAME**</code> is your actual username. To be consistent, we are expecting your username to be composed by your first name's initial, followed by your full lastname. As an example, in my case this notebook must be saved as <code>**gdinunzio_2022-02-15.ipynb**</code> (Remember to insert an underscore <code>**'_'**</code> between your username and the date).<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, go back to [Moodle](https://esami.elearning.unipd.it/) and check for the \"**2022-02-15 Python Programming Exam**\" item; there, you will be able to upload your notebook file for grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is no limit on the number of submissions; however, be careful when you upload a new version of this notebook because each submission overwrites the previous one. \n",
    "The due date indicated above is **strict**; after that, the system will not accept any more submissions and the latest uploaded notebook will be the one considered for grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "The archive you have downloaded (<code style=\"color:magenta\">**2022-02-15-exam.zip**</code>) is orgaized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code style=\"color:red\">**2022-02-15-exam**</code> (root)<br />\n",
